            Bhabhi - Classic Card game originating in the roots of North India. This game was a childhood favorite of mine and
            thought of seeing if there are any online version of this game so I could play it with family and friends. I was surprised 
            to find that there were none. So i decided I would make my own version. This site was created using front end techologies consisitng of 
            HTML, CSS, Javascript and librariessush as Bootstrap and React. The back end was created with C# and Node.js using the .NET framework.
